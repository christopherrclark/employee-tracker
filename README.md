# Employee Tracker

## Project Summary

The Goal of this assignment is to create an easy to use Content Management System (CMS) that allows a user to create a database of their departments, roles and employees using the command line. This command-line application accepts user input to view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role.
